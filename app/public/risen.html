                <h2>N: No Evidence of Falsehood. No Evidence of Falsehood. There is no known  incentive for the apostles to lie
                                            about the resurrection  and every incentive  to not proclaim the resurrection. . 
                                           One of the chief reasons to believe that the apostles honestly believed Jesus
                                           rose from the dead is letter E in the acronym, but another reason is that the 
                                        story of a crucified, risen Messiah goes against Jewish expectations of the Messiah and 
                                       a story of a crucified, risen deity would go against Roman expectations. If the Apostles  were
                                     dishonest and trying to craft a religion, we would expect them to craft a story that 
                                    falls more in line with cultural norms and expectations.

                       Many of these accounts happen in group settings where multiple people are experiencing  the same thing.
                       This is important because it rules out the hallucination theory that posits the idea that the disciples  were
                       just hallucinating.

                       to Christianity such as the Apostle Paul and James, the brother of Jesus, converted to Christianity. The fact 
                    that their were contemporary  people who were hostile to Christianity and converted after having a post resurrection 
                  appearance of Jesus, strengthens the idea that Jesus actually rose again.

                       suffering this same fate if they proclaimed the resurrection. Many of the disciples  did end up suffering the 
                      the death penalty  for proclaiming the resurrection and yet none of the apostles recanted or went back on their claim.
                     This shows that the disciples  really believed they saw Jesus after his death. How did the disciples  come to believe Jesus
                    rose from the dead? The theory that best fits all the facts is that the disciples came to believe in the resurrection because
                   Jesus actually rose from the dead.</h2>
