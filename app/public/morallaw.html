                    <p>
                        There are a few things to keep in mind:
                        <br>1. We will discover an absolute right by first discovering an absolute wrong.
                        <br>2. This works because we cannot take a moral stance without a moral law.
                        <br>3. We see the moral law more in our reactions than our actions because, like any law, we can break it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is the premise for all human rights and their proclamation.
                        <br>Without a universal moral law, everything is just opinion and one cannot definitively say that Hitler was wrong.
                        <br>Every human screws it up, which is why it is nigh-impossible to look at people's actions and see the law.
                        <br>Instead, we look at how people respond to being treated wrongly.
                        <br>There is a long list of people that everyone would deem evil, or at the very least, having done the wrong thing if it was turned back on themselves.
                        <br>This logic can be applied to sex offenders, government officials, and tyrants throughout history.
                        <br>It is seen as young as children, someone hurts or steals from them, and they cry and get angry.
                        <br>We tend to do those same things as adults when the same things happen to us.
                        <br>Yet, we have no problem doing those things to other people because it makes us feel powerful.
                        <br>Again, a universal law that we consult to acknowledge having been wronged, but we would rather ignore when acting for ourselves.
                        <br><i>Without a universal moral law, we have no grounds to say that it is factually accurate that Martin Luther King Junior was a better man than Adolf Hitler or Joseph Stalin.</i>
                    </p>
                    <p><b>B: Based on Reactions</b>
                    <br>Just like any law, the moral law can be broken. We see that with criminals and our interpersonal interactions. We ourselves break this law and our conscience
                    lets us know. That is to say that by looking at the actions of people throughout history, we are not able to see the law, but when we look at their reactions
                    throughout history, we are able to see the law at work. Whenever we see injustice, we see people wanting to get out from under it. Whenever someone steals our spot,
                    even if we do not own it but always use it, we get angry. We get upset at the <i>injustic</i> of it! That is the how we know that the law exists,
                    the way that we, and others, react when we percieve the law to be broken against ourselves.</p>
                    <p><b>U: Universal Similarities</b>
                    <br> I have heard it argued that moral laws exist, but are subjective to different times and places. I think the expressions of the objective law change
                    but if we observe throughout history, many things remain constant as the underlying infrastructure. There are similarites from today's laws to those
                    written by Hammurabi when he denoted the first written laws. Some cultures allow polygamy and other monogomy, but most all condemn cheating on your spouse.
                    And, again, we see the law more from peoples' reactions versus their actions. There are cultures out there that condone adultery and some that condone murder
                    but are the victims of these normative behaviors feeling fine with the results? Are they okay with their spouse cheating on them? Do people accept
                    being murdered with peace in their hearts?</p>
