                        There are a few things to keep in mind:
                        <br>1. We will discover an absolute right by first discovering an absolute wrong.
                        <br>2. This works because we cannot take a moral stance without a moral law.
                        <br>3. We see the moral law more in our reactions than our actions because, like any law, we can break it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is the premise for all human rights and their proclamation.
                        <br>Without a universal moral law, everything is just opinion and one cannot definitively say that Hitler was wrong.
                        <br>Every human screws it up, which is why it is nigh-impossible to look at people's actions and see the law.
                        <br>Instead, we look at how people respond to being treated wrongly.
                        <br>There is a long list of people that everyone would deem evil, or at the very least, having done the wrong thing if it was turned back on themselves.
                        <br>This logic can be applied to sex offenders, government officials, and tyrants throughout history.
                        <br>It is seen as young as children, someone hurts or steals from them, and they cry and get angry.
                        <br>We tend to do those same things as adults when the same things happen to us.
                        <br>Yet, we have no problem doing those things to other people because it makes us feel powerful.
                        <br>Again, a universal law that we consult to acknowledge having been wronged, but we would rather ignore when acting for ourselves.
                        <br><i>Without a universal moral law, we have no grounds to say that it is factually accurate that Martin Luther King Junior was a better man than Adolf Hitler or Joseph Stalin.</i>
