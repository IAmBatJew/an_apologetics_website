            <h1 class="cosmo">The Cosmological Argument</h1>
            <h2 id="cosmohead">This is Based Upon an Ontological Argument</h2>
            <p class="ontological"> 1. Everything with a beginning has a cause.
            <br>2. The universe had a beginning.
            <br>3. The universe has a cause.
            <br>Points one and three should be agreeable to everyone. The only point of contention should be number two.</p>
            <h2>How Do We Know the Universe Had a Beginning?</h2>
            <h3>Well, you could say that there it is a pretty S.U.R.E. thing!</h3>
            <p class="citation">Source: <i>I Don't Have Enough Faith to be an Atheist</i> by Frank Turek & Norman Geisler</p>
            <h2>S: Second Law of Thermodynaics</h2>
            <p class="cosmological">
                Otherwise known, in part, as the law of entropy, the basic premise of entropy is that everything goes from a state of order to disorder.
                <br>What does that have to do with a universal beginning? Well, if there was no beginning, that is due to the universe being infinite.
                <br>If the universe is infinite, there has been unlimited time for things to go from order to disorder, as such, we would have nothing in a state of order.
                <br>However, our entire universe is in a state of order, stars, planets, asteroids, etc. 
                <br>All of these things, if the universe has had an infinite past, should be nothing but dust.
            </p>
            <h2>U: Universal Expansion</h2>
            <p class="cosmological">
                Edward Hubble discovered that the universe is constantly expanding. How so?
                <br>Light shifts colors the farther it has to travel, so Hubble used this to his advantage.
                <br>By measuring light waves from "nearby" stars, he discovered that their wavelenghts were shifting.
                <br>Specifically, they were shifting from red (high energy) to blue (lower energy) light.
                <br>This indicated that the stars were moving further away and the light was having to travel a greater distance to the telescope than before.
                <br>The fact that things are moving away at a steady rate indicates the fact that, if we were to turn back the clock far enough,
                <br>everything would converge at a single point that it all exploded out from. Kind of like a BIG BANG!
            </p>
            <h2>R: Radiation Afterglow</h2>
            <p class="cosmological">
                One would expect something like the Big Bang to have some residual evidence, even all fo these billions of years later, right?
                <br>Well, great news! There is! Scientists Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson found some afterglow of cosmic microwave background radiation coming from the Big Bang.
                <br>Pretty neat, right?! They did this utilizing sensors up in space!
            </p>
            <h2>E: Einstein's Theory of General Relativity</h2>
            <p class="cosmological">
                In a nutshell, the theory is as follows: Time, Space, and Matter are all interdependent.
                <br>How is that relevant? Well, it means that all three had to come into existence at the same time since they cannot exist without each other.
                <br>If space and matter have had a beginning, as we have found in the evidence for the Big Bang
                <br>then time could not be infinite as it is interlinked with space and matter, which have a beginning.
                <br>No infinite time means that there was, indeed, a beginning.
            </p>
