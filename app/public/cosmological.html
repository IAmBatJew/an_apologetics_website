                        Edward Hubble discovered that the universe is constantly expanding. How so?
                        <br>Light shifts colors the farther it has to travel, so Hubble used this to his advantage.
                        <br>By measuring light waves from "nearby" stars, he discovered that their wavelenghts were shifting.
                        <br>Specifically, they were shifting from red (high energy) to blue (lower energy) light.
                        <br>This indicated that the stars were moving further away and the light was having to travel a greater distance to the telescope than before.
                        <br>The fact that things are moving away at a steady rate indicates the fact that, if we were to turn back the clock far enough,
                        <br>everything would converge at a single point that it all exploded out from. Kind of like a BIG BANG!

                        One would expect something like the Big Bang to have some residual evidence, even all fo these billions of years later, right?
                        <br>Well, great news! There is! Scientists Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson found some afterglow of cosmic microwave background radiation coming from the Big Bang.
                        <br>Pretty neat, right?! They did this utilizing sensors up in space!

                    <p class="cosmological">
                        The basic premise of entropy is that everything goes from a state of order to disorder.
                        <br>What does that have to do with a universal beginning? Well, if there was no beginning, that is due to the universe being infinite.
                        <br>If the universe is infinite, there has been unlimited time for things to go from order to disorder, as such, we would have nothing in a state of order.
                        <br>However, our entire universe is in a state of order, stars, planets, asteroids, etc. 
                        <br>All of these things, if the universe has had an infinite past, should be nothing but dust.

                        In a nutshell, the theory is as follows: Time, Space, and Matter are all interdependent.
                        <br>How is that relevant? Well, it means that all three had to come into existence at the same time since they cannot exist without each other.
                        <br>If space and matter have had a beginning, as we have found in the evidence for the Big Bang
                        <br>then time could not be infinite as it is interlinked with space and matter, which have a beginning.
                        <br>No infinite time means that there was, indeed, a beginning.
