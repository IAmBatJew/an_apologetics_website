                        Darwin himself said that his theory falls apart if there is any system that can not be broken down into smaller pieces without the system falling apart.
                        And the fact of the matter is this: there are systems in the universe and within plants and animals that cannot be broken down into smaller pieces without breaking.
                        This can be any of hte fine-tuned characteristics of the universe or the creation of a protein in a human cell, which on a basic level requires all of the following
                        simultaneous in order to work: DNA, RNA, mRNA, Ribosomes, and Endoplasmic Reticulums.
