                        <p>
                            Apologetics is looking at the outside world and utilizing science and logic to defend one's faith. An important note is the definition of "faith."
                            The most applicable definition, from Dictionary.com, is as follows: "belief that is not based on proof." Doesn't this contradict the very definition of Apologetics?
                            By no means! Faith is required for any worldview. Theists have faith that there is a being beyond the material universe. Atheists have faith that it was nothing that caused everything.
                            Defining one's faith is not definitively proving anything. Rather, it is being able to articulate why it is you believe your faith is more reasonable than another's.

                            There is a common misconception which has been perpetuated through popular media as well as academic institutions: Science has buried G-d. In other words science has,
                            seemingly, nullified the necessity of there being a god-like being. Evidence being put forth as nails in G-d's proverbial coffin have been things ranging from evolution
                            to the idea of aliens spreading life to other planets.
