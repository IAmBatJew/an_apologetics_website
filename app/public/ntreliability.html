                            Most scholars agree that most of the New Testament was written before 70 A.D.
                            That is within 40 years after Jesus'death. Some of the earliest manuscripts
                            we have are within 25 years of Jesus' death! <br>
                            The copies of the manuscripts that we have are <i>old</i>. When we read the Odyssey, the Iliad
                            or any number of other ancient texts we do not consider that they are different than the original stories.
                            We read them with the knowledge that they are going to be very similar to the story that is passed down
                            via oral tradition. In reality, <i>The Odyssey</i> has its earliest fragments 400 years after the original creation
                            and its earliest manuscript 1600 years later. Meanwhile, the New Testament has fragments within 25 years and full
                            within 225 years. The next-closest in manuscripts is Sophocles's plays at 505 years. That is almost double the time period!
                            All of that to say: the manuscripts that we have for the New Testament are classic copies that are closer to the events
                            than those of any other ancient texts.

                            We also have historical documents that corroborate the texts of Scripture. What does that mean?
                            How does this differ from the last point? It is different because these are either secular, or even,
                            anti-Christian documents. These include Josephus and Roman historical texts. They confirm that Jesus existed
                            that Jesus was a great moral teacher, and that He did claim to be the son of G-d.

                            Christian and secular archeologists alike have dug up many historical artifacts that corroborate the story of the Bible. 
                            These discoveries include items such as stone tablets with the name of King David
                            and other kings from the Old Testament, ancient cities that match descriptions found in the Bible, 
                            Roman documents containing descriptions of the death of the apostles that point out they refused to denounce
                            their faith in the face of immenent death, and so much more. It is worth dedicating a whole page to cover some 
                            of the archeaological discoveries that have been made that corroborate the Bible's texts.

                            According to journalist Lee Strobel, during investigations detectives/researchers are able to tell if people are lying 
                            when their stories match up too perfectly. "Why is that suspicious?" you may wonder. That is a great question, and one I had as well.
                            One would assume giving the same story would lend to credibility, not to incredulity. However, when you think about it, it does make sense.
                            When you and a friend talk about a day you spent together, different things stand out to different people. Let's say you saw a movie.
                            You might recount the day as, "We went to see a film with Brad Pitt!" while your friend, who has a celebrity crush, might recall, "Oh yeah! We 
                            that film with Hugh Jackman!" While I do not think a movie with those two starring together exists, the point stands: you remember different people
                            because you value them differently. On the other hand, if you both said, "We saw the film Hugh-ge Pitts directed by Steven Spielberg and starring
                            Hugh Jackan and Brad Pitt," people might get suspicious about the specificity and similarity of your answers.<br>
                            More succinctly: different people remember different details due to experiencing the same event differently. The differences, if they are
                            found between details of a story rather than overarching plots and themes, lend credibility that the story is true because while the core
                            of the tale remains the same it highlights the genuine experience of each person recounting the event.

                            We not only have classic copies of the manuscripts, but the <i>number</i> of manuscripts that we have is mind-boggling. 
                            We have a mile-high pile worth of manuscripts and fragments of the Bible's texts. Far more than would allow for someone
                            to alter them all, meaning we can have high confidence that the ancient texts we are seeing, which are extremely close to exact copies,
                            are the genuine texts that were written by the original authors. The sheer number in conjunction with the relative proximity in time to
                            the events of the gospels is indicative that the Bible is able to be trusted as accurate.
