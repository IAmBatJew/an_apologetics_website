        <h3>Early</h3>
            <p>
                The texts were written chronologically near to
                the events that are discussed. Is this true?
                <br>
                Yes!
                <br>
                Most scholars agree that most of the New Testament was written before 70 A.D.
                That is within 40 years after Jesus'death. Some of the earliest manuscripts
                we have are within 25 years of Jesus' death!
            </p>
        <h3>Eye-Witness</h3>
            <p>
                What good is an early testimony if it is written by people
                who were totally uninvolved? Good news is, our manuscripts
                were, at the very least, seen by those who walked with Jesus
                as they were ciruclated during their lifetimes within their churches.
            </p>
        <h3>Expected</h3>
            <p>
                This one takes some faith. Jesus fulfilled many Old Testament
                prophecies, from vague to oddly specific. The texts offer testimony
                that is to be expected based upon the Old Testament's prophecies.
            </p>
        <h3>Extra-Biblical</h3>
            <p>
                There are sources that back up the events and claims of the New Testament.
                These range from Roman records to the Jewish historian Josephus.
            </p>
        <h3>Examinable</h3>
            <p>
                This ties into the Eye-Witness testimony. The texts of the Bible have historically
                verfiable claims, names, and statements that all line up with the historical records.
            </p>
        <h3>Embarassing</h3>
            <p>
                If a person is creating a story and narrative, odds are high that they will make
                themselves look good and try to save face. After all, who would know? Yet, the authors of
                the Bible share story after story of times they have screwed up and fallen short of expectations.
                If you were trying to start a religion and crafting stories from your mind, would <i>you</i> put in details that make you feel ashamed? 
            </p>
        <h3>Excrutiating</h3>
            <p>
                Not only did the authors suffer embarassment from the events of the Bible, but the New Testament authors suffered extreme pain as a result of their testimonies.
                This ranged from beatings and lashings to crucifixion and public execution to ostricization from their friends and families.
                The authors lost literally everything and all they had to do was admit that they were wrong or made it up.
                People are willing to suffer and die for something they believe to be true, but they are not willing to do so for something they know to be false.
                If anyone was to know if the stories in the gospels were true about Jesus and His miracles, would it not be the people who traveled with him?
                The same people who were killed for their testimonies of Jesus and who were given freedom from death and pain if they only denounced their faith and claims?
